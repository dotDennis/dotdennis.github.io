# Portfolio 

A fully responsive portfolio website with a simple display of my projects:

- Datamaskinarkitektur
- Lego Project
- Mappeprosjekt


## How to run

Simplest solution: Live server


## TO DO:

- 1. Webp img formats.
- 2. Add page navigation (Tricky to find on project pages)
- 3. Consider different solutions to */js/assets/projects.js
- 4. Rewrite the overused elseif statements on components. Switch statement & try/catch blocks.
- 5. 404 page
- 6. redirect to 404 page when projects fail to load due to missing requirements.
- 7. Improve accessibility
- 8. "ME" page.
